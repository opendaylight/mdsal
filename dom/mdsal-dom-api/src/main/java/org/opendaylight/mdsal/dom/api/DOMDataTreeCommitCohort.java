/**
 * Commit cohort participating in commit of data modification, which can validate data tree
 * modifications, with option to reject supplied modification, and with callbacks describing state
 * of commit.
 *
 * <h2>Performance implications</h2>
 * {@link DOMDataTreeCommitCohort}s are hooked up into commit of data tree changes and MAY
 * negatively affect performance of data broker / store.
 * Implementations of this interface are discouraged, unless you really need ability to veto data
 * tree changes, or to provide external state change in sync with visibility of committed data.
 *
 * <h2>Implementation requirements</h2>
 * <h3>Correctness assumptions</h3> Implementation SHOULD use only the {@link DOMDataTreeCandidate} instances and
 * provided {@link SchemaContext} for validation purposes.
 * Use of any other external mutable state is discouraged, implementation MUST NOT use any
 * transaction related APIs on same data broker / data store instance during invocation of
 * callbacks, except ones provided as argument. Note that this MAY BE enforced by some
 * implementations of {@link DOMDataBroker} or DOMDataCommitCoordinator
 * Note that this may be enforced by some implementations of {@link DOMDataTreeCommitCohortRegistry}
 * and such calls may fail.
 * <h3>Correct model usage</h3> If implementation is performing YANG-model driven validation
 * implementation SHOULD use provided schema context.
 * Any other instance of {@link SchemaContext} obtained by other means, may not be valid for the
 * associated DOMDataTreeCandidates and it may lead to incorrect validation or processing of provided
 * data.
 * <h3>DataTreeCandidate assumptions</h3> Implementation SHOULD NOT make any assumptions on a
 * {@link DOMDataTreeCandidate} being successfully committed until associated
 * {@link PostCanCommitStep#preCommit()} and
 * {@link org.opendaylight.mdsal.common.api.PostPreCommitStep#commit()} callback was invoked.
 * <h2>Usage patterns</h2>
 * <h3>Data Tree Validator</h3>
 * Validator is implementation, which only validates {@link DOMDataTreeCandidate} instances and does not
 * retain any state derived from edited data - does not care if a {@link DOMDataTreeCandidate} was
 * rejected afterwards or transaction was cancelled.
 * Implementation may opt-out from receiving {@code preCommit()}, {@code commit()}, {@code abort()}
 * callbacks by returning {@link PostCanCommitStep#NOOP}.

     *
     * <p>
     * Note the implementations are expected to do validation and processing asynchronous. Implementations SHOULD do
     * processing fast, and are discouraged from blocking on any external resources. Implementation MUST NOT access
     * any data transaction related APIs during invocation of the callback. Note that this may be enforced by some

     * @return a FluentFuture which will successfully complete with the user-supplied implementation of
     *         {@link PostCanCommitStep} if all candidates are valid, or a failed future with a

     *         {@link DOMDataTreeCandidate} instance did not pass validation. Users are encouraged to use
