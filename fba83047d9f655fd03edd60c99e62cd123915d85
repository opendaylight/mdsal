      "message": "Right, but the way this is wired is really appropriate for OSGi.\n\nNote here we really want the codec wired separately, as that is what provides the core configuration. This is especially true for single-classloader frameworks, as a codec implementation which knows it can reach the totality of classes does not need a classLoadingStrategy.\n\nIf we take that out, the only thing remaining is AdapterFactory -- hence that should grow annotations.",
