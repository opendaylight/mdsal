/**
 *
 * The "action" statement is used to define an operation connected to a
 * specific container or list data node. The "action" statement defines
 * an action node in the schema tree. Under the action node, a schema node
 * with the name "input" and a schema node with the name "output" are also
 * defined. The nodes "input" and "output" are defined in the moduleâ€™s namespace.
 *
 * The difference between an action and an rpc is that an action is tied
 * to a node in the datastore, whereas an rpc is not.
 *
 * Action replaces concept of routed RPC and comes up with implicit InstanceIdentifier
 * context, whereas routed RPC defines explicit leaf for this purpose.
