* The purpose of generated class in src/main/java for Union types is to create new instances of unions from a string representation. * In some cases it is very difficult to automate it since there can be unions such as (uint32 - uint16), or (string - uint32). * The reason behind putting it under src/main/java is: * This class is generated in form of a stub and needs to be finished by the user. This class is generated only once to prevent * loss of user code. */ public class Int32StringUnionBuilder {
