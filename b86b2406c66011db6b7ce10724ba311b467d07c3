      "message": "I assume moving 2 yang files to yang-disabled is related to this.  Can you elaborate a little more on this part and how it\u0027s related to leafref lookup? Does \u0027yang-disabled\u0027 have special significance to the parser or did you just pick that to get them out of \u0027yang\u0027 so they\u0027re not compiled? If the latter, why not just remove them?",

Just order of patches due to code freeze.\n\nietf-hardware.yang triggers the issue which is being fixed, hence it could not have landed, without which our features would not be completed. ietf-hardware-state depends on ietf-hardware.\n\nHence I landed the features and empty artifacts beforehand.\n\nNow that the issue is fixed, the two models are moved into their normal place, causing them to be compiled and the pre-existing artifacts getting the content they should have.",
