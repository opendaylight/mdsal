At any rate this is not what I meant. \n\nNote how LeafNodeCodecContext is allocated from a codepath which has knowledge of the expected return type -- see BindingContextContext.getLeafNodes() and how it calls getGetterName() -- doing exactly what we are trying to replicate here.\n\nSo the question is: how is the name of the method we are trying to look up here related to leaf.getGetter().getName()? I would think they are the same.",
