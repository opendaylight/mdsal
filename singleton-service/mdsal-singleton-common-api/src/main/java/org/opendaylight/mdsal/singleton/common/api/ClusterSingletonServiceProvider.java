/**
 * {@link ClusterSingletonServiceProvider} provides a functionality to register and group services
 * {@link ClusterSingletonService} by service group identifier. Services could be Applications or RPCs.
 * Provider provides a functionality which allows to have only one fully instantiated service instance
 * in a cluster at one time and service group means to have all service instances for the same group
 * situated on same Cluster Node. This is realized via a double candidate approach where a service
 * group instance maintains a candidate registration for ownership of the service group entity in the
 * cluster and also a registration that acts as a guard to ensure a service group instance has fully
 * closed prior to relinquishing service group ownership. To achieve ownership of the service group,
 * a service group candidate must hold ownership of both these entities.
