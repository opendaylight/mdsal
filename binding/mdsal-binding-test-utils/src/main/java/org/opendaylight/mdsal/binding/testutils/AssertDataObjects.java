/**
 * Assertion utilities for YANG {@link DataObject}s.
 *
 * <p>This compares two {@link DataObject}s by creating a textual representation of them,
 * and comparing them.  If they are not equals, then the thrown ComparisonFailure provides
 * for a very highly readable comparison due to a syntax which immediately makes the difference obvious.
 *
 * <p>The syntax used happens to be valid Xtend code, and as such could be directly copy/pasted
 * into an *.xtend source file of an expected object definition.  This is optional though; this
 * utility can very well be used with any object, not necessarily created by Xtend source code.
 *
 * <p>This also works for any Java object that is not a {@link DataObject},
 * like the {@link AssertBeans} which this is based upon.
