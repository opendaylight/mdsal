/**
 * Assertion utilities for YANG {@link DataObject}s.
 *
 * <p>This compares two {@link DataObject}s using their {@link Object#equals(Object)} methods, but
 * prepares a view of their contents in text form which allows easy comparison of the expected and
 * actual values using the thrown {@link ComparisonFailure}.
 *
 * <p>The syntax used happens to be valid Xtend code, and as such could be directly copy/pasted
 * into an *.xtend source file of an expected object definition.  This is optional though; this
 * utility can very well be used with any object, not necessarily created by Xtend source code.
 *
 * <p>This also works for any Java object that is not a {@link DataObject},
 * like the {@link AssertBeans} which this is based upon.
