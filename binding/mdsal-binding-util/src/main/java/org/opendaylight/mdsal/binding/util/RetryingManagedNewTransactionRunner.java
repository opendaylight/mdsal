/**
 * Implementation of {@link ManagedNewTransactionRunner} with automatic transparent retries.
 *
 * <h3>Details about the threading model used by this class</h3>
 *
 * <p>This class runs the first attempt to call the delegated {@link ManagedNewTransactionRunner},
 * which typically is a {@link ManagedNewTransactionRunnerImpl} which safely invokes {@link WriteTransaction#commit()},
 * in the using application's thread (like a {@link MoreExecutors#directExecutor()} would, if this were an
 * {@link Executor}, which it's not).
 *
 * <p>Any retry attempts required, if that <code>submit()</code> (eventually) fails with an
 * {@link OptimisticLockFailedException}, are run in the calling thread of that eventual future completion by a
 * {@link MoreExecutors#directExecutor()} implicit in the constructor which does not require you to specify an
 * explicit Executor argument.  Normally that will be an internal thread from the respective DataBroker implementation,
 * not your application's thread anymore, because that meanwhile could well be off doing something else!  Normally,
 * that is not a problem, because retries "should" be relatively uncommon, and (re)issuing some DataBroker
 * <code>put()</code> or <code>delete()</code> and <code>re-submit()</code> <i>should</i> be fast.
 *
 * <p>If this default is not suitable (e.g. for particularly slow try/retry code), then you can specify
 * another {@link Executor} to be used for the retries by using the alternative constructor.
