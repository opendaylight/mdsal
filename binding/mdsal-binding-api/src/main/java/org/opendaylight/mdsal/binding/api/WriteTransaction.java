/**
 * A transaction that provides mutation capabilities on a data tree.
 *
 * <p>
 * Initial state of write transaction is a stable snapshot of the current data tree. The state is captured when
 * the transaction is created and its state and underlying data tree are not affected by other concurrently running
 * transactions.
 *
 * <p>
 * Write transactions are isolated from other concurrent write transactions. All writes are local to the transaction
 * and represent only a proposal of state change for the data tree and it is not visible to any other concurrently
 * running transaction.
 *
 * <p>
 * Applications make changes to the local data tree in the transaction by via the <b>put</b>, <b>merge</b>,
 * and <b>delete</b> operations.
 *
 * <h2>Put operation</h2>
 * Stores a piece of data at a specified path. This acts as an add / replace operation, which is to say that whole
 * subtree will be replaced by the specified data.
 *
 * <p>
 * Performing the following put operations:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1) container { list [ a ] }
 * 2) container { list [ b ] }
 * </pre>
 * will result in the following data being present:
 *
 * <pre>
 * container { list [ b ] }
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Merge operation</h2>
 * Merges a piece of data with the existing data at a specified path. Any pre-existing data which is not explicitly
 * overwritten will be preserved. This means that if you store a container, its child lists will be merged.
 *
 * <p>
 * Performing the following merge operations:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1) container { list [ a ] }
 * 2) container { list [ b ] }
 * </pre>
 * will result in the following data being present:
 *
 * <pre>
 * container { list [ a, b ] }
 * </pre>
 * This also means that storing the container will preserve any augmentations which have been attached to it.
 *
 * <h2>Delete operation</h2>
 * Removes a piece of data from a specified path.
 *
 * <p>
 * After applying changes to the local data tree, applications publish the changes proposed in the transaction
 * by calling {@link #commit} on the transaction. This seals the transaction (preventing any further writes using this
 * transaction) and commits it to be processed and applied to global conceptual data tree.
 *
 * <p>
 * The transaction commit may fail due to a concurrent transaction modifying and committing data in an incompatible way.
 * See {@link #commit} for more concrete commit failure examples.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation Note:</b> This interface is not intended to be implemented by users of MD-SAL, but only to be
 * consumed by them.
