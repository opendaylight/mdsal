/**
 * Commit cohort participating in commit of data modification, which can validate data tree
 * modifications, with option to reject supplied modification, and with callbacks describing state
 * of commit.
 *
 * <h2>Performance implications</h2>
 *
 * {@link DataTreeCommitCohort}s are hooked up into commit of data tree changes and MAY
 * negatively affect performance of data broker / store.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are discouraged, unless you really need ability to veto data
 * tree changes, or to provide external state change in sync with visibility of commited data.
 *
 * <h2>Implementation requirements</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Correctness assumptions</h3> Implementation SHOULD use only provided
 * {@link DataTreeModification} for validation purposes.
 *
 * <p>
 * Use of any other external mutable state is discouraged, implementation MUST NOT use any
 * transaction related APIs on same data broker / data store instance during invocation of
 * callbacks, except ones provided as argument. Note that this MAY BE enforced by some
 * implementations of {@link DataBroker} or Commit coordinator
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this may be enforced by some implementations of {@link DataTreeCommitCohortRegistry}
 * and such calls may fail.
 *
 * <h3>DataTreeCandidate assumptions</h3> Implementation SHOULD NOT make any assumptions on
 * {@link DataTreeModification} being successfully committed until associated
 * {@link PostCanCommitStep#preCommit()} and
 * {@link org.opendaylight.mdsal.common.api.PostPreCommitStep#commit()} callback was invoked.
 *
 * <h2>Usage patterns</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Data Tree Validator</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Validator is implementation, which only validates {@link DataTreeModification} and does not
 * retain any state derived from edited data - does not care if {@link DataTreeModification} was
 * rejected afterwards or transaction was cancelled.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementation may opt-out from receiving {@code preCommit()}, {@code commit()}, {@code abort()}
 * callbacks by returning {@link PostCanCommitStep#NOOP}.
 *
 * <p>
 * TODO: Provide example and describe more usage patterns

     * will be prevented, with the DataBroker transaction providing the thrown exception as the cause of failure.
     *
     * <p>
     * Note the implementations are expected to do validation and processing asynchronous. Implementations SHOULD do
     * processing fast, and are discouraged from blocking on any external resources. Implementation MUST NOT access
     * any data transaction related APIs during invocation of the callback. Note that this may be enforced by some
     * implementations of {@link DataTreeCommitCohortRegistry} and such calls may fail.

     *         {@link PostCanCommitStep} if all candidates are valid, or a failed future with a

     *         {@link DataTreeModification} instance did not pass validation. Users are encouraged to use
