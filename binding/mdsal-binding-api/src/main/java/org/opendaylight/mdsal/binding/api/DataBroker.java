/**
 * Provides access to a conceptual data tree store and also provides the ability to
 * subscribe for changes to data under a given branch of the tree.
 *
 * <p>
 * All operations on the data tree are performed via one of the transactions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Read-Only - allocated using {@link #newReadOnlyTransaction()}
 * <li>Write-Only - allocated using {@link #newWriteOnlyTransaction()}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * These transactions provide a stable isolated view of data tree, which is guaranteed to be not
 * affected by other concurrent transactions, until transaction is committed.
 *
 * <p>
 * For a detailed explanation of how transaction are isolated and how transaction-local changes are
 * committed to global data tree, see {@link ReadTransaction}, {@link WriteTransaction}
 * and {@link WriteTransaction#commit()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is strongly recommended to use the type of transaction, which provides only the minimal
 * capabilities you need. This allows for optimizations at the data broker / data store level. For
 * example, implementations may optimize the transaction for reading if they know ahead of time that
 * you only need to read data - such as not keeping additional meta-data, which may be required for
 * write transactions.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation Note:</b> This interface is not intended to be implemented by users of MD-SAL,
 * but only to be consumed by them.
