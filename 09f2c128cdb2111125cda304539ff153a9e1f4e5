      "message": "yeah - not sure what I was thinking here. Dict transfers all the delegate service properties which includes service instance-specific ones like \"service.id\" and \"service.bundleid\" but those get set properly in the new instance. (However I\u0027m not sure if modifiedService -\u003e setProperties would overwrite them) \"osgi.service.blueprint.compname\" technically doesn\u0027t apply to the new service instance but I think it\u0027s OK. So I changed Dict back to the way it was.",
