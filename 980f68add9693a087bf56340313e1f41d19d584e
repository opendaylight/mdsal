      "message": "I think we should be consistent the other way around. The reasons for rfc-based naming are two:\n- it makes it clear this is a standard, published model\n- there are instances when a single RFC defines multiple models (for example ietf-{inet,yang}-types) -- mix-n-matching there is actually harmful\n\nGoing forward I would like to consolidate naming and rework packaging, so we have a feature-per-rfc.",
