      "message": "Not sure I follow. This is needed for yang code generation - it\u0027s not related to mdsal dom/binding APIs. It makes sense for the general-entities yang model to be here since it\u0027s common to both dom and binding APIs. We had previously added a general-entities yang model to sal-common-api in the controller project which is equivalent to this bundle.\n\nSo what exactly is illegal here and what would you suggest? I suppose we could put the general-entities yang model in the mdsal-binding-api bundle but it really is common to both.",
